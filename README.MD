# Plot Points Frontend

This is the front end portion of our DigitalCrafts capstone project, _Plot Points_, which is [deployed live here](https://plotpointsfrontend.onrender.com/). This project was the last two weeks of a 16-week coding bootcamp. For more information, check out our Medium articles by [Adam](https://medium.com/@adamtwright7/plot-points-aaa04249c550) or [Jess](https://medium.com/@jessbecoding/plot-points-ea134ed6b7ab).

This pairs with the [backend section](https://github.com/adamtwright7/capstone-backend) of the project, which is deployed live and already supporting the frontend behind the scenes.

## Walkthrough
